# Getting Started with AACT
Check out this repository as your first step in getting involved with AACT at the University of Washington. 

Shout out to [OreSat](http://oresat.org/) for giving us the idea of including this type of thing for students getting started. 

## Get Familiar with CubeSats
 - Read the [Wikipedia page on Cubesats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat). This is a surprisingly good summary of CubeSats.
 - Read NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative [CubeSat 101](https://www.nasa.gov/content/cubesat-launch-initiative-resources) document.
 - CAREFULLY read the [CubeSat Design specification (CDS)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5418c831e4b0fa4ecac1bacd/t/56e9b62337013b6c063a655a/1458157095454/cds_rev13_final2.pdf). As we design OreSat, we'll constantly refer to this design spec so understanding it deeply is a good idea.
 - The [Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa)](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/elana/index.html) is an initiative of the NASA's Launch Services Program. ELaNa schedules and flies CubeSats that were accespted by CSLI. We haven't been manifested yet, but when we do, it'll be through ELaNa.

## Check out AACT Resources
 - We use GitHub to manage all of the code, CAD and tex files (among others). You can google "GitHub tutorials" and get a ton of good resources to help you learn how it works. GitHub has its [own guides](https://guides.github.com/) as well.
 - Written documents, such as ICDs, requirements, ConOps, etc are all located on our Google Team Drive. One of the admins can add you to this once you join.
 - [Our website](aact.space) has some more details on our current mission, the team, and the facilities.

## Come to AACT Shop Hours
 - The best way to get involved is to start coming to shop hours. These are **Wednesday 2-5pm** each week, and are times when there is guaranteed to be somebody in the lab working away. Come and have your questions answered, tinker with hardware, learn new things, and make progress on your satellite componets!
 
## Learn Github
This should probably be near the top but, this is a pretty cool tutorial visualizing how branching and everything works in github. Even if you've done github before this can definately help you sharpen your skills. The Tutorial is this webpage:
